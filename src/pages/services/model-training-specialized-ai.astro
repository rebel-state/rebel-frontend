While foundation models like GPT-4 are impressive, they lack the specific, nuanced knowledge of your industry, your company’s internal history, and your proprietary methodology. rebel-state specializes in Model Training and Specialized AI, taking the raw power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and sharpening them into precision instruments for your specific business.`,

        description: `<img src="/assets/images/hero-image.png" alt="Curating data" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4"/>\n\nOur process centers on Data Sovereignty and Domain Adaptation. We help you identify and curate your \"Hidden Knowledge\"—the thousands of documents, emails, Slack logs, and project files that contain the true DNA of your organization. We then use this data to fine-tune models or implement advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. This ensures that the AI's responses are grounded in your reality, minimizing \"hallucinations\" and maximizing utility. We are experts in techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA, which allow us to train high-performing models efficiently without the astronomical costs traditionally associated with AI development.`,

        description: `Security is our primary directive. Many businesses are hesitant to use AI because they fear their data will be used to train public models. rebel-state solves this by deploying private, local, or VPC-hosted instances where your data never leaves your controlled environment. We don't just train the model; we optimize its "Context Window" and performance metrics to ensure it is fast, cost-effective, and accurate. Whether you need a model that understands the intricacies of maritime law, the specific coding standards of your engineering team, or the medical nuances of a specialized clinic, rebel-state builds the "Brain" that powers your organization’s future.`,
