        We transform your "Hidden Knowledge"—the thousands of documents, emails, and project files that define your
        business—into a specialized AI. This is not just another tool; it's a new, proprietary intelligence, a "brain"
        for your organization that provides precise, secure, and contextually-aware insights.
