      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What we build</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We begin with a deep audit of your technology stack to identify the "glue work"—manual data transfers, reconciliations, and ad-hoc scripts that slow your team down. From there we design bespoke middleware, internal dashboards, and standalone applications that eliminate those friction points.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Our automation goes beyond simple "If This Then That" logic: we build robust, testable systems using modern languages and frameworks to ensure longevity and low maintenance overhead. Every solution is built with observability, error-handling, and modularity in mind.</p>
      <p>When you reduce manual toil, your team can focus on high-leverage activities: strategy, product development, and customer outcomes.</p>
