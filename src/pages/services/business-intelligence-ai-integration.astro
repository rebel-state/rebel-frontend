    <h2>Refine data into insight</h2>
    <p>Most businesses are drowning in data but starving for insights. We implement ETL, data unification, and predictive modeling so leadership can move from reactive to proactive decisions.</p>
    <h3>Integration</h3>
    <p>We bake AI into workflows rather than bolting it on, delivering dashboards and alerting systems that notify stakeholders of critical anomalies and opportunities in real time.</p>
