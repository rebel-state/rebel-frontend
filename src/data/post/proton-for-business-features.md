Implementing a new suite of tools across an organization requires more than just great apps for employees; it requires powerful, intuitive administrative controls for IT managers and business owners. Proton for Business delivers on this with a robust admin console that makes it easy to manage your team's security and productivity.

Here are some of the key features that put you in control.

### 1. Centralized Administrator Console

Forget juggling multiple dashboards. The Proton for Business admin console is your single source of truth for managing your organization.

*   **User Management:** Easily create, modify, or suspend user accounts. You can assign different permission levels, such as making another user an administrator.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Allocate storage space to individual users and monitor usage across your organization.
*   **Security Policies:** Enforce strong security practices by setting organization-wide policies, such as requiring two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users.

### 2. Custom Domain and Branding

Maintaining a professional brand identity is crucial. Proton for Business allows you to use your own domain for your team's email addresses.

*   **Professional Emails:** Instead of generic addresses, your team can send emails from `name@yourcompany.com`, reinforcing your brand with every communication.
*   **Easy Setup:** The admin console provides clear, step-by-step instructions for verifying your domain and configuring the necessary DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) to ensure email deliverability and security.
*   **White-Labeling:** You can add your company's logo to the Proton login page, creating a seamless and professional experience for your employees.

### 3. Private and Secure by Default

The most powerful feature is the one that's always on: end-to-end encryption. As an administrator, you can be confident that your company's internal communications, files, and schedules are protected from outside access.

*   **Data Confidentiality:** Your company's sensitive data, from financial reports to intellectual property, is encrypted and inaccessible to anyone but your authorized users.
*   **Compliance:** For businesses in regulated industries like healthcare (HIPAA) or finance, Proton's security model can be a key part of your compliance strategy.

### 4. Seamless Migration and Support

Switching to a new provider can be a challenge, but Proton makes it easy.

*   **Easy Switch Tool:** Proton provides a simple tool to migrate your existing emails, calendars, and contacts from other providers like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.
*   **Priority Support:** Business customers get access to priority support from Proton's dedicated team, ensuring you have help when you need it.

With Proton for Business, you don't have to choose between security and usability. Its powerful administrative features give you the control you need to run your business efficiently while ensuring your data remains private and secure.
