In the fight to protect your online accounts, a strong password is no longer enough. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a critical second layer of defense, and the authenticator app is one of the most popular methods for generating 2FA codes. Today, we introduce a new contender in this space: **Proton Authenticator**.

Developed by the same team behind Proton Mail and Proton VPN, this app brings Proton''s signature focus on security, privacy, and transparency to the world of 2FA.

### Why Another Authenticator App?

The market has several established authenticator apps, but many are offered by companies whose business models rely on data collection. Proton Authenticator is different. It’s designed from the ground up to be a simple, secure, and private way to manage your 2FA tokens.

Key advantages include:

*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Like all Proton services, the authenticator is designed with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that no one but you can access your 2FA codes.
*   **Open Source and Audited:** The application is fully open source, allowing independent security experts to verify its code and ensure it is free from vulnerabilities or backdoors.
*   **Part of a Trusted Ecosystem:** If you already trust Proton for your email, calendar, or VPN, using their authenticator is a natural extension. It’s a product built on a proven foundation of security and a mission to protect user privacy.
*   **No Ads, No Trackers:** The app is free to use and contains no advertising or third-party trackers. Its only purpose is to secure your accounts.

### How It Works

Proton Authenticator works just like other time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps. You scan a QR code provided by the service you want to secure (like your Google, Twitter, or bank account), and the app will generate a rotating 6-digit code every 30 seconds. When you log in, you’ll enter your password and then this code from the app to verify your identity.

### A Commitment to Security for Everyone

Proton's mission is to make online security and privacy accessible to all. Proton Authenticator is a free, easy-to-use tool that can drastically improve the security of your online life. By choosing an authenticator from a company with a proven track record in privacy, you can be confident that your digital security is in good hands.
