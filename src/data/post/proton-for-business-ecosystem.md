For a modern business, data is everything. From internal communications and strategic plans to client information and financial records, protecting this data is paramount. While many companies rely on a patchwork of services from different providers, this approach can create security vulnerabilities.

**Proton for Business** offers a unified, secure, and private alternative. It's an all-in-one suite of essential productivity tools, all protected by default with end-to-end encryption.

### One Integrated Suite for All Your Needs

Proton for Business consolidates your core services into a single, trusted ecosystem, simplifying your IT management and enhancing your security posture. The suite includes:

*   **Proton Mail:** Secure, encrypted email that ensures your business communications remain confidential. Use your own custom domain (`you@yourcompany.com`) to maintain a professional brand identity.
*   **Proton Calendar:** An encrypted calendar to keep your schedules, appointments, and business plans private.
*   **Proton Drive:** End-to-end encrypted cloud storage for your sensitive files, contracts, and intellectual property. Securely share files with clients and partners with password-protected, expiring links.
*   **Proton VPN:** Protect your team's internet connections, secure access to company resources, and ensure online activity remains private, whether in the office or working remotely.

### The Power of a Unified Ecosystem

Using a single, encrypted ecosystem provides benefits that go beyond the security of any individual app:

*   **Reduced Risk:** Consolidating with one trusted provider reduces your attack surface and eliminates the weak links that can be created by using multiple services with varying security standards.
*   **Simplified Administration:** A central administrator console allows you to manage all your users, email addresses, and security settings from one place.
*   **Increased Productivity:** Your team gets a seamless experience with tools that are designed to work together, all accessible with a single, secure login.
*   **Data Sovereignty:** With its base in Switzerland, Proton for Business operates under some of the world's strongest privacy laws, giving you peace of mind that your data is protected from government overreach.
