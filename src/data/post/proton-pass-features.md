A modern password manager should do more than just store passwords. It should help protect your entire identity. Proton Pass excels at this by integrating unique features that go far beyond simple credential storage.

Let's explore two of its most powerful features: **email aliases** and **encrypted notes**.

### Shield Your Inbox with Email Aliases

Every time you sign up for a new online service, you hand over your personal email address, exposing it to potential spam, phishing, and inclusion in data breach lists. Proton Pass solves this with **hide-my-email aliases**.

**What it is:**
An email alias is a unique, randomly generated email address (e.g., `service.xyz@passmail.net`) that forwards all incoming mail to your primary inbox.

**How it works:**
When you're creating a new account, the Proton Pass browser extension will offer to create an alias for you with a single click. You use this alias to sign up. The service sends emails to the alias, and Proton forwards them to you.

**The benefits are immense:**
*   **Privacy:** The online service never learns your real email address.
*   **Spam Control:** If an alias starts receiving spam, you can simply disable it. This stops the spam immediately without affecting your other accounts.
*   **Breach Containment:** If a service you signed up for suffers a data breach, only the alias is exposed. This makes it easy to identify which service was breached and prevents attackers from linking your identity across different platforms.

### Secure More Than Just Passwords with Encrypted Notes

Your digital life contains plenty of sensitive information that isn't a password. This could be software license keys, Wi-Fi passwords, credit card details, or private memos. Storing this information in a plain text file or a standard notes app is a major security risk.

**What it is:**
Proton Pass allows you to create **encrypted notes** within your vault. These are free-form notes that are protected by the same robust, end-to-end encryption as your passwords.

**How it works:**
You can create a new note from within the Proton Pass app or browser extension. Give it a title and add your content. You can also store credit card details in a pre-formatted entry type. Once saved, the information is encrypted and securely synced across all your devices.

**Why it's useful:**
*   **Centralized Security:** Keep all your sensitive information in one secure, easily accessible place.
*   **Zero-Access Encryption:** No one but you can read your notes—not even Proton.
*   **Cross-Platform Sync:** Your secure notes are available on your phone, laptop, and desktop, so you always have them when you need them.

### Conclusion

By mastering email aliases and encrypted notes, you can elevate your use of Proton Pass from simple password management to comprehensive identity protection. These features provide powerful, easy-to-use tools to defend your privacy in an increasingly interconnected world.
