When you upload a file to a cloud service, you're not just storing data; you're making a choice about who you trust to hold it. While the services offered by Big Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox are popular and feature-rich, their business models and legal obligations often put them at odds with user privacy.

Proton Drive was built to be a direct alternative, one based on the principle of **data sovereignty**: the idea that you, the user, should have ultimate control over your data.

### The Problem with Mainstream Cloud Storage

Most major cloud providers use encryption, but it's typically "encryption-at-rest." This means while your files are encrypted on their servers, the company itself holds the encryption keys.

This model has several critical weaknesses:

*   **No Real Privacy:** The provider can decrypt your files at any time. They may do this to scan your content for advertising purposes, to comply with government requests, or in the event of a rogue employee.
*   **Vulnerability to Breaches:** If the provider's systems are breached, attackers could potentially gain access to the encryption keys and, therefore, all user data.
*   **Broad Legal Jurisdiction:** Companies based in the US are subject to laws like the CLOUD Act, which can compel them to hand over user data to law enforcement, sometimes without the user's knowledge.

### The Proton Drive Difference: You Hold the Keys

Proton Drive's **end-to-end encryption** model is fundamentally different. Your files are encrypted on your device *before* they are uploaded. The encryption keys are derived from your password, which Proton never sees.

| Feature | **Proton Drive** | **Big Tech Providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Access** | **Zero-Access:** Only you can decrypt your files. | The provider can access and scan your files. |
| **Jurisdiction** | **Switzerland:** Protected by strong privacy laws. | **United States:** Subject to broad surveillance laws like the CLOUD Act. |
| **Business Model** | Subscription-based. User privacy is the product. | Often ad-supported or part of a larger data-collection ecosystem. |
| **Transparency** | Open-source apps and public security audits. | Closed-source and proprietary. |

### Why Swiss Jurisdiction Matters

Proton's home base in Switzerland is a key part of its security promise. Switzerland is not a member of the EU or any major surveillance alliances. It has a long history of neutrality and a strong legal framework protecting privacy.

For your data, this means:
*   Any request for user data must be validated by a Swiss court.
*   Proton can only hand over what it has—and thanks to its zero-access architecture, all it has is encrypted gibberish.

### Conclusion: A Conscious Choice for Privacy

Choosing Proton Drive over a Big Tech alternative is more than a technical decision; it's a philosophical one. It's a choice to move away from a model where your data is a commodity and towards one where you retain full ownership and control. While other services may offer more free storage or deeper integration with their product suites, Proton Drive offers something far more valuable: true data sovereignty.
