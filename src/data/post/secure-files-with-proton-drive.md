Cloud storage services have become an indispensable part of modern life. They offer convenience, accessibility, and a safeguard against local data loss. However, most major cloud providers hold the encryption keys to your data, meaning they can access, scan, and share your files.

**Proton Drive** offers a different, more secure paradigm: a cloud storage solution where privacy is the default, not an afterthought.

### True Privacy with End-to-End Encryption

Like all products in the Proton ecosystem, Proton Drive is built on a foundation of **end-to-end encryption**. This means your files are encrypted on your device *before* they are uploaded to Proton's servers.

*   **What this means for you:** Only you can access your files. Proton cannot decrypt or view your data, even if they were compelled to by a legal order. Your files, their contents, and even their filenames are fully encrypted.
*   **The technical details:** Proton Drive uses strong, battle-tested cryptographic libraries to ensure your data is impenetrable. This zero-access architecture puts you in complete control of your data.

### Based in Privacy-Friendly Switzerland

Proton is based in Switzerland, a country with some of the world's strongest privacy laws. This provides a robust legal framework that protects your data from overreaching government surveillance, an extra layer of protection that providers based in other jurisdictions cannot offer.

### Key Features of Proton Drive

Proton Drive is designed to be both highly secure and easy to use.

*   **Secure File and Folder Sharing:** Share your files with anyone, even if they don't have a Proton account, using secure, password-protected links. You can also set expiration dates for your links to ensure your data doesn't remain exposed forever.
*   **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Access your files from anywhere with the web app and dedicated mobile apps for Android and iOS. A desktop app for Windows and macOS allows for seamless file synchronization.
*   **Version History:** Proton Drive keeps previous versions of your files, allowing you to restore them if you make a mistake or need to revert to an older copy.
*   **Generous Free Plan:** Proton offers a free plan with enough storage to get you started, making it easy for anyone to experience the benefits of private cloud storage.

### Who Should Use Proton Drive?

While everyone can benefit from more private cloud storage, Proton Drive is especially valuable for:

*   **Professionals:** Lawyers, journalists, and doctors who handle sensitive client or patient data.
*   **Individuals:** Anyone who wants to store personal documents, family photos, or financial records without worrying about them being scanned or monetized.
*   **Businesses:** Companies that need to protect their intellectual property and internal documents.

In an age where your personal data is a commodity, Proton Drive represents a powerful choice to reclaim your privacy. It provides the convenience of the cloud without the privacy compromises.
