Switching to a new authenticator app can seem daunting, but Proton Authenticator makes the process simple and secure. This guide will help you get set up in just a few minutes.

### Step 1: Install the App

First, you need to download Proton Authenticator on your mobile device. It is available for free on both iOS and Android.

*   **For iOS:** Visit the Apple App Store.
*   **For Android:** Visit the Google Play Store.

Download and install the app just as you would any other.

### Step 2: Add Your First Account

Once the app is installed, it’s time to add an account. For this to work, you need to log in to the website or service you want to protect (e.g., your email provider, social media account, or financial institution) and navigate to its security settings.

1.  **Find the 2FA / MFA Settings:** In your account's security settings, look for an option labeled "Two-Factor Authentication," "Multi-Factor Authentication," or "Login Verification."
2.  **Choose "Authenticator App":** The service will likely offer multiple 2FA methods (like SMS or email). Select the option to use an "Authenticator App" or "TOTP."
3.  **Display the QR Code:** The website will display a QR code on your screen. This is the code you need to scan.

### Step 3: Scan the QR Code with Proton Authenticator

Now, open the Proton Authenticator app on your phone.

1.  Tap the **plus sign (+)** to add a new account.
2.  Your phone's camera will activate. Point it at the QR code displayed on your computer screen.
3.  The app will instantly recognize the code and add the account to your list. It will immediately start generating 6-digit time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).

### Step 4: Verify and Save

To complete the setup, the website will ask you to enter the current 6-digit code from your Proton Authenticator app.

1.  Type the code from the app into the verification field on the website.
2.  Click "Verify," "Enable," or "Confirm."

That's it! Your account is now protected by Proton Authenticator. The website may also provide you with a set of backup codes. **It is crucial that you save these codes in a secure location**, like a password manager or a physical safe. If you lose your phone, these codes will be the only way to get back into your account.

### Step 5: Log In with 2FA

The next time you log in to that service, you will first enter your username and password. You will then be prompted to enter the 6-digit code from your Proton Authenticator app to complete the login.

You've now successfully enhanced your account's security with a best-in-class, private, and secure authenticator app.
