Connecting to a VPN server is a great first step, but Proton VPN offers a suite of powerful tools that can take your security to the next level. If you're not using its advanced features, you're missing out on some of the best protection the service has to offer.

This guide will walk you through three of Proton VPN's most powerful features and how to use them.

### 1. Secure Core: The Ultimate Defense Against Network Attacks

**What it is:** Secure Core is arguably Proton VPN's signature feature. It routes your traffic through multiple servers before it leaves the Proton network. The first servers in the chain are located in highly secure data centers in privacy-friendly countries like Switzerland, Iceland, and Sweden.

**Why you should use it:** If a hacker or government agency were to monitor the exit server you're connected to, they would only be able to trace the traffic back to the Secure Core server, not to your original IP address. This provides a critical layer of protection against sophisticated, nation-state-level adversaries. It's an essential tool for journalists, activists, and anyone dealing with highly sensitive information.

**How to use it:**
1. In the Proton VPN app, look for the "Secure Core" toggle or list.
2. Instead of selecting a single country, choose one of the Secure Core server routes (e.g., `Switzerland -> USA`).
3. Connect as usual. Your traffic will now be multi-hopped through the secure core network.

### 2. NetShield: Your Personal Ad and Malware Blocker

**What it is:** NetShield is a DNS filtering feature that prevents your devices from connecting to domains that host ads, trackers, and malware. It works at the network level, meaning it protects every application on your device, not just your browser.

**Why you should use it:**
- **Enhanced Privacy:** Blocks trackers that follow you across the web.
- **Improved Security:** Prevents you from accidentally visiting malicious websites that could compromise your device.
- **Faster Browsing:** By cutting out ad and tracker scripts, web pages often load significantly faster.

**How to use it:**
1. In the app's settings or main screen, find the NetShield (shield icon) settings.
2. Choose your level of protection: you can opt to block only malware or to block malware, ads, and trackers.
3. Once enabled, it works automatically whenever you are connected to the VPN.

### 3. Tor over VPN: Anonymity on a Global Scale

**What it is:** This feature seamlessly integrates the anonymity of the Tor network with the security of Proton VPN. With a single click, you can route all your traffic through the volunteer-run Tor network after it has been encrypted by the VPN.

**Why you should use it:** It provides an extra layer of anonymity, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace your activity. It also allows you to access Onion sites (.onion) directly through your browser without needing to install the Tor Browser separately. This is useful for accessing sensitive information or for situations where maximum anonymity is required.

**How to use it:**
1. In the list of available servers, look for the ones with a Tor (onion) icon next to them.
2. Select one of these designated "Tor over VPN" servers.
3. Connect. Your traffic is now being routed through the Proton VPN server and then into the Tor network.

By mastering these three features, you can transform Proton VPN from a simple privacy tool into a comprehensive security suite.
