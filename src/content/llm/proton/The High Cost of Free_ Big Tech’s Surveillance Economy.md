Big Tech’s business model fundamentally relies on **surveillance capitalism**, a system where profit is generated by extracting, analyzing, and monetizing user data 1\. Because companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft depend on this data to fuel advertising revenue and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, they cannot implement strong privacy protections—such as end-to-end encryption—without undermining their own revenue streams 2, 3\.  
This inherent conflict of interest compromises digital privacy for both individuals and organizations in the following ways:

### 1\. Monetization Through Surveillance and Profiling

The core economic logic of Big Tech is that **if a service is free, the user is the product** 4\. To generate revenue, these companies track users extensively to create detailed behavioral profiles.

* **Targeted Advertising:** Platforms like Meta and Google collect vast amounts of personal information—including location, device data, and browsing history—to sell hyper-targeted advertising 5, 6\. For instance, nearly 98% of Meta’s revenue and 77% of Alphabet’s revenue comes from ads, incentivizing them to maximize data collection rather than minimize it 3\.  
* **Cross-Platform Tracking:** Tracking is not limited to a single app. Through tools like the Meta pixel and Single Sign-On (SSO) services, companies track users across the web, even when they are not using the company's specific apps 2, 7\.  
* **Inferred Identity:** Even when data is technically "anonymized," Big Tech possesses enough data points to re-identify individuals by cross-referencing datasets, such as location history or social media profiles 8, 9\.

### 2\. AI as a Data Extraction Engine

The integration of AI into everyday products has accelerated data collection, turning intimate interactions into training data and ad signals.

* **Training on User Data:** Companies use personal data—including photos, posts, and documents—to train their Large Language Models (LLMs) 10, 11\. For example, LinkedIn uses user profile data and posts for AI training by default 12, and Google’s Gemini can process sensitive information from Gmail, Drive, and Docs to improve its models 13, 14\.  
* **Monetizing Intimacy:** AI chatbots encourage users to share sensitive health, financial, or emotional information. Meta has begun using data from AI chats on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook to target ads, commercializing private conversations 15, 16\.  
* **Total Surveillance via Browsers:** The push by AI companies to acquire or build browsers (such as ChatGPT Atlas) aims to capture a complete record of user intent and online behavior to build predictive models, extending surveillance beyond search queries 17, 18\.

### 3\. The Data Broker Ecosystem

Big Tech feeds into a largely unregulated "shadow economy" of data brokers.

* **Selling and Trading:** Data collected by apps and platforms is often sold to data brokers, who aggregate it into dossiers containing financial records, health signals, and location history 19, 20\.  
* **Lack of Oversight:** This industry operates with little transparency. In the US, for example, there is virtually no federal law regulating the sale of this data, allowing it to be purchased by insurance firms, hedge funds, and even foreign entities 21, 22\.

### 4\. Compromising Organizational Security

For businesses, reliance on Big Tech infrastructure introduces significant security and sovereignty risks.

* **Lack of Encryption:** Services like Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace generally do not use end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This means the service provider retains the keys to decrypt and view organizational files, creating a risk of data exposure through internal scanning or data breaches 23, 24\.  
* **AI Security Risks:** When businesses store files in environments integrated with tools like Microsoft Copilot, sensitive proprietary data may be accessed, indexed, or summarized by the AI, potentially exposing trade secrets or internal strategies 25, 26\.  
* **Loss of Sovereignty:** European organizations relying on US-based tech are subject to US surveillance laws, such as the CLOUD Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This allows the US government to compel tech companies to hand over data stored on their servers, regardless of where the server is physically located 27, 28\.

### 5\. Government Surveillance Partner

By centralizing vast troves of unencrypted data, Big Tech companies effectively become "one-stop shops" for government surveillance.

* **Warrantless Access:** Governments can bypass the need for warrants by simply purchasing location and behavioral data from data brokers 29\.  
* **Legal Compulsion:** In the US, agencies can use National Security Letters (NSLs) or FISA court orders to demand user data from tech giants. Between 2014 and 2024, data requests to major tech companies increased dramatically, with the US government making nearly 500,000 requests in a single year 30, 31\.  
* **Backdoors:** Governments, including the UK and China, increasingly pressure tech companies to weaken encryption or build backdoors, which compromises security for all users by creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers and hostile states 32, 33\.
