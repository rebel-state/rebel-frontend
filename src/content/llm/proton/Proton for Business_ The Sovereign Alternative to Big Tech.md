# Secure Your Legacy: Why Proton for Business is the Superior Alternative to Big Tech

In the modern digital economy, data is not just an asset; it is a liability if mishandled. For years, businesses have defaulted to "free" or convenient suites like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, accepting a silent tradeoff: productivity in exchange for privacy. However, as cyber threats escalate and Big Tech’s hunger for data to train artificial intelligence (AI) grows, that tradeoff has become a significant business risk. **Proton for Business** offers a paradigm shift—a comprehensive, end-to-end encrypted ecosystem designed to protect your organization’s intellectual property, communications, and identity from surveillance and exploitation.

### The Big Tech Problem: You Are the Fuel

The fundamental difference between Proton and giants like Google or Microsoft lies in the business model. Big Tech companies primarily generate revenue through advertising and data monetization. Consequently, services like Gmail and Outlook generally do not use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default, meaning the service provider retains the keys to decrypt and access your company’s data 1\. This access allows them to potentially share your data with third parties or use it to train their AI models 2, 3\.  
Furthermore, relying on US-based tech giants exposes European and international businesses to US surveillance laws. Under regulations like the Cloud Act, US authorities can compel companies like Google and Microsoft to hand over data stored on their servers, regardless of where that data is physically located 2\.

### The Proton Solution: Privacy by Default

Proton offers a fundamentally different proposition: **privacy by default**. Founded by scientists who met at CERN, Proton is headquartered in Switzerland, a country with some of the world's strictest privacy laws 4\. Because Proton uses zero-access and end-to-end encryption, your business data—whether it is emails, calendar events, or files—is encrypted on your device before it reaches Proton's servers 5\. This means that no one, not even Proton, can access your data 4\.  
Proton’s business model is transparent and aligned with your interests. The company is funded 100% by the community of users who pay for subscriptions, not by advertisers 6\. There are no venture capital investors to please, and the company is primarily owned by the nonprofit Proton Foundation, ensuring its mission to advance privacy remains permanent 7, 8\.

### A Complete Ecosystem for the Modern Enterprise

Proton for Business is no longer just secure email; it is a complete productivity suite that rivals Big Tech capabilities while eliminating the privacy risks.

#### 1\. Proton Mail: Professionalism Meets Security

Proton Mail for Business allows you to set up custom domain email addresses (e.g., name@yourcompany.com), which is essential for establishing professional credibility 9\. Unlike standard providers, Proton Mail secures your communications with E2EE, ensuring that sensitive negotiations, client data, and internal strategies remain confidential 10\. It includes advanced features like "Proton Scribe," a privacy-first AI writing assistant that runs locally to help draft and proofread emails without exposing your data to external servers 11\.

#### 2\. Proton Drive and Sheets: Secure Collaboration

For years, businesses stuck with Google Drive because of its collaborative features. Proton has closed that gap. **Proton Drive** now includes **Proton Docs** and **Proton Sheets**, allowing teams to create documents and spreadsheets, edit them in real-time, and leave comments 12, 13\. Crucially, every keystroke and cursor movement is encrypted 12\.  
With **Proton Sheets**, businesses can move away from Excel or Google Sheets, securing financial records and employee data in a way that prevents data leaks 14\. Additionally, the new **Suggesting Mode** in Docs allows for secure redlining and contract review, making it ideal for legal and financial sectors 15\. You can even collaborate with external partners who do not have Proton accounts, maintaining security without friction 16\.

#### 3\. Proton Pass: Defending Identity

The majority of data breaches stem from weak or reused passwords. **Proton Pass for Business** is an identity manager that allows admins to enforce security policies and ensure employees use strong, unique credentials 17\. It supports passkeys for faster, phishing-resistant logins and includes a built-in 2FA authenticator 18, 19\.  
Proton Pass also includes **Proton Sentinel**, a high-security program that combines AI with human analysis to monitor for account takeover attempts 24/7, providing a level of defense that is vital for high-value targets 20\.

#### 4\. Proton VPN: Network Security Everywhere

With the rise of remote work, securing network access is non-negotiable. **Proton VPN for Business** allows organizations to lease dedicated IP addresses and segment access to resources, ensuring that only authorized employees can access sensitive company servers 21\. It protects employees on public Wi-Fi and bypasses censorship in restrictive regions, ensuring business continuity globally 22\.

#### 5\. Lumo: Confidential AI

While companies scramble to adopt AI, many fear data leakage. Proton introduces **Lumo for Business**, a private AI assistant. Unlike ChatGPT or Copilot, which may log data for training, Lumo operates under a strict no-logs policy 23\. Your conversations are never used to train AI models, allowing your team to use AI for summarizing sensitive meeting notes or analyzing datasets without risking confidentiality 24\.

### Compliance and Sovereignty

For organizations in regulated industries, Proton is a game-changer.

* **HIPAA & GDPR:** Proton simplifies compliance with major data protection regulations. The platform creates a secure environment for handling ePHI (electronic protected health information) and includes comprehensive Business Associate Agreement (BAA) coverage 25, 26\.  
* **ISO 27001 Certified:** All Proton apps are ISO 27001 certified, verifying that their security controls meet rigorous industry standards 27\.  
* **Audit Transparency:** Unlike the "black box" code of Big Tech, all Proton apps are open source and independently audited, meaning the security claims can be verified by anyone 6\.

### Transitioning is Effortless

A common fear for businesses is the disruption of migration. Proton solves this with **Easy Switch**, a tool that seamlessly migrates emails, calendars, and contacts from Google or Outlook to Proton in just a few clicks 28\. Furthermore, Proton offers a **14-day free business trial**, allowing teams to test drive the full suite—including Mail, Calendar, Drive, VPN, and Pass—with no commitment 29\.

### Conclusion: A Strategic Advantage

Choosing Proton for Business is not just a security decision; it is a strategic one. In an era where data breaches cost businesses millions and consumer trust is fragile, using a Swiss-based, encrypted ecosystem signals to your clients that you value their privacy as much as they do.  
By moving to Proton, you are opting out of the surveillance economy and reclaiming ownership of your digital assets. You are choosing a partner that cannot exploit your data because they cannot see it.
